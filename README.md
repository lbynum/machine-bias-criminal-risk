# Exploring and Visualizing Hate Crimes Across the United States

## Group Members:
	Our team consists of two members: Preethi and Lucius. Given that we have only two members, we decided that having
	strictly defined roles would not benefit our project. Instead, we will have equal ownership over the Project
	Manager/Director of Research/Director of Computation/Reporter roles. Preethi will lead in the Project Manager 
	and Director of Computation roles, and Lucius will lead in the Director of Research and Reporter roles. 

## Purpose:
	Our project will explore the Hate Crime dataset provided by the investigative news organization ProPublica. 
	ProPublica is currently running an entire campaign to document hate crimes
	(https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/hatecrimes). Their overall goal is to “take a rigorous look at hate 
	crimes in America – combining data analysis, social media newsgathering, and ambitious investigative storytelling.”
	While we are confident ProPublica’s work will be thorough and well-thought-out, in the meantime, we hope to leverage
	their current data to create insightful visualizations and perform semantic analysis.  

## Data:
	The data comes from the ProPublica Data Store. It is freely available and (relatively) clean, although some data
	cleaning will still be necessary. The dataset includes the title, date, publisher, location, and a brief summary 
	of hate crimes from news stories collected by Google News. The data spans from February to August 2017 and contains
	2664 observations. 

## Variables:
	The variables include the title, date, publisher, location, and a brief summary. The main variables of interest are
	title, summary, date, and location (city and state). 

## End Product:
	Our end product will be a set of visualizations/graphs and potentially a Shiny application (if used in the process of
	creating our visualizations). Along with our visualizations, we will provide a narrative to explain our process and
	findings. Potential topics to investigate include the frequency of hate crimes over time, the distribution of hate
	crimes geographically, and the types of hate crimes that have occurred over this period (using semantic analysis
	approaches on the summaries).
