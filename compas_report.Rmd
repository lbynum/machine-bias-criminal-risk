# Introduction

ProPublica obtained this data with the goal of analyzing Northpointe Inc.’s commercial recidivism modeling tool -- COMPAS. Aggregating data from public records, they collected data on 18,610 individuals who received COMPAS scores from 2013 to 2014, including demographic information, public criminal records, and incarceration records.

*How are COMPAS scores used?*

ProPublica describes that at least in Broward County, they “primarily [use] the score to determine whether to release or detain a defendant before his or her trial.” 11,757 of the individuals in the database had their COMPAS scores used to assess whether or not they should be released before their trial.

*What are COMPAS scores?*

There are three types of COMPAS score. Each measures a type of ‘risk’ associated with a criminal re-offending in some way on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high). As ProPublica describes, these include 

- *Risk of Recidivism*: ProPublica defines this as the person in question committing a “criminal offense that [results] in a jail booking and [takes] place after the crime for which the person was COMPAS scored.”  Northpointe hopes to use this score to predict “a new misdemeanor or felony offense within two years of the COMPAS administration date.”
- *Risk of Violence*: They use the FBI definition of violent crime: 
    
    *In the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the UCR Program as those offenses which involve force or threat of force. - ucr.fbi.gov*

- *Risk of Failure to Appear*: As evidenced by the name, this describes a failure to appear at the court hearing. 


# Exploratory Data Analysis

We first load in the data provided by ProPublica, and take a quick look at summaries of each variable to get a sense of distribution and potential outliers. We'll look at half of the columns at a time to keep things manageable. 

```{r}
compas_data <- read.csv('compas-scores-two-years.csv')
summary(compas_data[1:(ncol(compas_data)/2)])
```

Here we notice there may be large outliers in many of the crime count variables, such as `juv_fel_count`, `juv_misd_count`, `juv_other_count`, and `priors_count`. We expect these are simply accurate observations corresponding to individuals with high numbers of prior offenses. Thus we will not remove these individuals from the data but will be aware of them as potential influential points when we later fit any models. We also note that the values for the 'days_from' variables are quite variable which may be relevant if we use those variables in later analysis. Looking at the second half of the columns, we have:

```{r}
summary(compas_data[(ncol(compas_data)/2 + 1):ncol(compas_data)])
```

With the second half we have similar characteristics as before. We remove the `violent_recid` column given that all values are `NA` (as mentioned in the data dictionary). Apart from that column, we make no other changes.

## ProPublica's Bias-Assessment Model

This section is meant to recreate ProPublica's logistic regression model for assessing bias in COMPAS scores. The code and explanations in this section are adapted from their [published methodlogy and code](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis). 

Using the same data set, they first filter rows based on the following criteria.

1. consider only individuals with a COMPAS score
2. assure the COMPAS score corresponds to the correct crime i.e. the score was given within 30 days of the arrest
3. do not include ordinary traffic offenses

Next we use their code to perform this filtering:

```{r}
# code from https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
df <- compas_data %>%
  select(age, c_charge_degree, race, age_cat, score_text, sex, priors_count, days_b_screening_arrest, decile_score, is_recid, two_year_recid, c_jail_in, c_jail_out) %>% 
  filter(days_b_screening_arrest <= 30) %>%
  filter(days_b_screening_arrest >= -30) %>%
  filter(is_recid != -1) %>%
  filter(c_charge_degree != "O") %>%
  filter(score_text != 'N/A')
nrow(df)
```

In order to use this data to assess racial bias in scoring, the ProPublica analysts first create several factor variables from the existing columns.

```{r}
# code from https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
df <- mutate(df, crime_factor = factor(c_charge_degree)) %>%
      mutate(age_factor = as.factor(age_cat)) %>%
      within(age_factor <- relevel(age_factor, ref = "25 - 45")) %>%
      mutate(race_factor = factor(race)) %>%
      within(race_factor <- relevel(race_factor, ref = "Caucasian")) %>%
      mutate(gender_factor = factor(sex, labels= c("Female","Male"))) %>%
      within(gender_factor <- relevel(gender_factor, ref = "Male")) %>%
      mutate(score_factor = factor(score_text != "Low", labels = c("LowScore","HighScore")))
```

For the `age_factor` they make "25 - 45" the reference level, for `race_factor` "Caucasian" is the reference level, for `gender_factor` "Male" is the reference level. 

Next they fit a logistic regression model to predict `score_factor` from the other variables.

```{r}
# code from https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
pp_model <- glm(
  score_factor ~ gender_factor + age_factor + race_factor + priors_count + crime_factor + two_year_recid, 
  family="binomial", 
  data=df
)
summary(pp_model)
```

#### Calculating Relative Risk by Demographic

Next they compute how much more likely different demographic groups are to receive a higher score than others. The logistic regression model allows us to measure this difference after correcting for the other variables included in the model. The quantity ProPublica uses to compare black defendants to white defendants (or men to women, old defendants to young defendants, etc.) is called **relative risk**. ProPublica does not explain where this quantity comes from in their analysis, so we'll provide some quick background on logistic regression to justify the calculation. The following explanation is inspired by USC professor Sandy Eckel's slides [here](http://www-hsc.usc.edu/~eckel/biostat2/notes/notes14.pdf).

Logistic regression models a linear relationship between the log odds ratio for the probability of interest and the given predictor variables. An odds ratio measures the odds of success

$$\texttt{odds ratio} = \frac{\texttt{probability of success}}{\texttt{probability of failure}} = \frac{P}{1 - P}$$

where $P$ is the probability of success. The log odds ratio is simply the log of this quantity. Thus the logistic regression model for observation $x_i$ is

$$\log(\frac{P_{x_i}}{1-P_{x_i}}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_px_{ip}$$

where the probability of success for $x_i$ is $P_{x_i}$, and we have $p$ predictors with corresponding coeffecients $\beta_j$ and observed values $x_{ij}$ for $j=1,\ldots,p$. Given that our model here uses categorical predictors (factors), the coeffecients we estimate give us the **change in log odds** for the corresponding variable. Thus if we let $P_{x_i}$ be the probability that individual $x_i$ gets a high COMPAS score, then with coefficent $\beta_1$ for `gender_factor`, we would have

$$\beta_0: \text{the log odds of getting a high COMPAS score for men}$$
$$\beta_1: \text{the difference in log odds of getting a high COMPAS score for women compared to men}$$

The important observation here is that because men are the reference level for the `gender_factor` categorical variable, $\beta_1$ measures a **difference** relative to men. Thus if we want to answer the question, "How much more likely are women to get a high COMPAS score than men?" we'll want to use

$$\beta_0 + \beta_1: \text{the log odds of getting a high COMPAS score for women}$$

to get the comparison. One other observation will also be helpful to calculate relative risk. We solve for $P_{x_i}$ as follows.

$$\log(\frac{P}{1 - P}) = x \rightarrow P = \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x} = \texttt{sigmoid}(x)$$

Thus we calculate relative risk for the categorical variable corresponding to $\beta_1$ as:

$$\texttt{relative risk} = \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\texttt{sigmoid}(\beta_0 + \beta_1)}{\texttt{sigmoid}(\beta_0)}$$

ProPublica computes relative risk to compare blacks to whites, men to women, and people under 25 to middle-aged people in terms of COMPAS scores. They get the following results.

```{r}
# code adapted from https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
model_intercept <- coef(pp_model)['(Intercept)']
black_coef <- coef(pp_model)['race_factorAfrican-American']
(relative_risk_black_v_white <- sigmoid(model_intercept + black_coef) / sigmoid(model_intercept))
```

As ProPublica states, this shows us that "Black defendants are 45% more likely than white defendants to receive a higher [COMPAS] score correcting for the seriousness of their crime, previous arrests, and future criminal behavior." Similarly, women are 19.4\% more likely than men and people under 25 are 2.5 times as likely as middle aged people to get a higher score:

```{r}
# code adapted from https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
woman_coef <- coef(pp_model)['gender_factorFemale']
(relative_risk_woman_v_man <- sigmoid(model_intercept + woman_coef) / sigmoid(model_intercept))
```

```{r}
# code adapted from https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
age_coef <- coef(pp_model)['age_factorLess than 25']
(relative_risk_young_v_middleage <- sigmoid(model_intercept + age_coef) / sigmoid(model_intercept))
```

# Our Logistic Regression Model

# Comparing Our Model's Predictive Performance to the COMPAS Model

To get valid predictions for the training data, we use 10-fold cross-validation.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
all_predictions <- data.frame(id = compas_data$id, predicted_score = NA)
  
# split the data into 10 folds
all_indices <- 1:nrow(compas_data)
folds <- createFolds(all_indices, k = 10)

for (i in 1:10) {
  # make train/test split
  test_indices <- folds[[i]]
  training_indices <- all_indices[-test_indices]
  test_data <- compas_data[test_indices,]
  training_data <- compas_data[training_indices,]
  # build model on training data
  vars <- training_data %>% 
    select(sex, age, ends_with('count'), c_charge_degree, is_recid)
  regmod <- glm(is_recid ~., family = binomial(link='logit'), data = vars)
  # store predictions on test data
  predicted_scores <- predict(regmod, newdata = test_data, type = 'response')
  all_predictions[names(predicted_scores),]$predicted_score <- predicted_scores
}
predicted_scores <- all_predictions$predicted_score
confusionMatrix(data = as.numeric(predicted_scores > 0.5), reference = compas_data$is_recid)
```

# Using ProPublica's Bias-Assessment Model on Our Model

We can see if our model suffers from the same bias using ProPublica's bias-assessment methodology. We'll set up the same model they did, but this time instead of predicting `score_factor` for the COMPAS score, we'll create a `score_factor` variable *from our model's predictions*. We create a new data frame with `new_score` as our risk of recidivism score. We also create a `new_score_text` variable that defines score categories in the same way, but this time based on a 0-1 scale instead of a 0-10 scale. Recall ProPublica defined this category as: High=8-10, Medium=5-7, Low=1-4. Thus we'll do: High=0.75-1.0, Medium=0.45-0.75, Low=0-0.45.

```{r}
our_scores <- compas_data %>%
  mutate(new_score = predicted_scores) %>%
  mutate(
    new_score_text = as.factor(
      ifelse(new_score >= 0.75, 'High',
             ifelse(new_score >= 0.45, 'Medium', 'Low')))
  )
```

Now we train the same bias-assessment model, this time using `new_score` instead of `decile_score` and `new_score_text` instead of `score_text`.

```{r}
new_df <- our_scores %>%
  select(age, c_charge_degree, race, age_cat, new_score_text, sex, priors_count, days_b_screening_arrest, new_score, is_recid, two_year_recid, c_jail_in, c_jail_out) %>% 
  filter(days_b_screening_arrest <= 30) %>%
  filter(days_b_screening_arrest >= -30) %>%
  filter(is_recid != -1) %>%
  filter(c_charge_degree != "O") %>%
  filter(new_score_text != 'N/A') %>%
  mutate(crime_factor = factor(c_charge_degree)) %>%
  mutate(age_factor = as.factor(age_cat)) %>%
  within(age_factor <- relevel(age_factor, ref = "25 - 45")) %>%
  mutate(race_factor = factor(race)) %>%
  within(race_factor <- relevel(race_factor, ref = "Caucasian")) %>%
  mutate(gender_factor = factor(sex, labels= c("Female","Male"))) %>%
  within(gender_factor <- relevel(gender_factor, ref = "Male")) %>%
  mutate(score_factor = factor(new_score_text != "Low", labels = c("LowScore","HighScore")))
```

```{r}
new_pp_model <- glm(
  score_factor ~ gender_factor + age_factor + race_factor + priors_count + crime_factor + two_year_recid, 
  family="binomial", 
  data=new_df
)
```

## Bias against black vs. white people

```{r}
model_intercept <- coef(new_pp_model)['(Intercept)']
black_coef <- coef(new_pp_model)['race_factorAfrican-American']
(relative_risk_black_v_white <- sigmoid(model_intercept + black_coef) / sigmoid(model_intercept))
```

<!-- ## Bias against women vs. men -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- woman_coef <- coef(new_pp_model)['gender_factorFemale'] -->
<!-- (relative_risk_woman_v_man <- sigmoid(model_intercept + woman_coef) / sigmoid(model_intercept)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Bias against under 25 vs. middle-aged -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- age_coef <- coef(new_pp_model)['age_factorLess than 25'] -->
<!-- (relative_risk_young_v_middleage <- sigmoid(model_intercept + age_coef) / sigmoid(model_intercept)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Mitigating Bias

Much work has been done exploring techniques that allow for fair modeling and prediction in the presence of biased data or algorithms, and this area of study is rich and actively researched. Researchers Faisal Kamiran and Toon Calders, in their 2011 paper 
"Data preprocessing techniques for classification without discrimination," describe several techniques that *alter the given dataset* to (ideally) eliminate the source of the bias. Several other techniques deal with modifying classification/regression algorithms themselves to make fairer predictions. Here, the general idea is to instead clean the bias out of the data, after which normal classification methods can be used. Before we discuss the techniques we employ for dealing with bias, we first introduce a few key concepts.

#### Algorithmic Bias

[This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias) provides a nice overview of different types of Algorithmic bias and several examples. Bias can manifest in an algorithm in various ways and can have multiple causes. The Wikipedia article linked above uses to term "pre-existing bias" to loosely describe a type of bias resulting from baking social or institutional biases into algorithms. Here the source of bias is not necessarily the algorithm but instead the values encoded into it by its creators or by the data it sees. For our brief foray into algorithmic bias here, we focus on this type of bias under the assumption that some underlying bias does exist in the United States criminal justice system and thus in our data set. 

#### Protected/Sensitive Attributes

The term *protected attribute* or *sensitive attribute* typically refers to a discriptor of an individual upon which it is illegal to discriminate under the Fair Work Act. These include characteristics such as sexual orientation, gender identity, and race. 

#### Combatting Algorithmic Bias

Broadly speaking, research in algorithmic bias works to (1) identify where and in what way bias is present (ProPublica's analysis is one such example), (2) come up with ways to constrain models to enforce fair predictions, or (3) alter the underlying data to minimize bias in the data itself. For our recidivism predictions, we'll employ some techniques from category 3 -- altering the underlying data -- based on Kamiran and Calders' work.

## Mitigating Bias Through Data Preprocessing

Kamiran and Calders outline four types of techniques for preprocessing to mitigate bias, described at length in their paper:

1. **Suppression:** Given a sensitive attribute S, find and remove S and the other features most correlated with S.
2. **Massaging the dataset:** Given a sensitive attribute S, swap the labels of some observations with differing values for S to decrease discrimination while maintaining the same overall class distribution. 
3. **Reweighing:** Up- or down-weight observations in the training data based on whether they have an under- or over-represented combinations of sensitive attribute S and the response variable.  
4. **Sampling:** Calculate sample sizes for combinations of sensitive attribute S and the response that would, as Kamiran and Calders put it, "make the dataset descrimination-free." Then under- or over-sample observations accordingly to create a data set with those proportions.  

Here we focus on Sampling. 

### Applying Sampling to the COMPAS Data to Combat Racial Bias

To narrow the scope of this report, we focus on *racial bias* against black people as compared to white people, and we implement sampling to combat this type of bias only. If our example words for racial bias, we could theoretically extend it to each of the protected attributes in the data.

First we need to establish what the class imbalance is between blacks and whites in our data. We look for an imbalance in terms of recidivism rates, since recidivism is what our model predicts.

```{r}
(recid_rates <- compas_data %>%
  select(race, is_recid) %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarize(yes_recid = sum(is_recid == 1), no_recid = sum(is_recid == 0)))
```

Focusing on African-Americans and Caucasians and plotting this table as a bar chart, we have:

```{r}
compas_data %>%
  filter(race %in% c('African-American', 'Caucasian')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = is_recid, color = race)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 2) +
    facet_wrap(~ race)
```

Kamiran and Calders define four types of observation with respect to a protected attribute and a class label. Their definitions are as follows:

- Deprived community with positive class labels (DP)
- Deprived community with negative class labels (DN)
- Favored community with positive class labels (FP)
- Favored community with negative class labels (FN)

In our case these correspond to:

- DP: African-Americans with `is_recid` = 1
- DN: African-Americans with `is_recid` = 0
- FP: Caucasians with `is_recid` = 1
- FN: Caucasians with `is_recid` = 0

```{r}
DP_data <- compas_data %>%
  filter(race == 'African-American' & is_recid == 1)
DN_data <- compas_data %>%
  filter(race == 'African-American' & is_recid == 0)
FP_data <- compas_data %>%
  filter(race == 'Caucasian' & is_recid == 1)
FN_data <- compas_data %>%
  filter(race == 'Caucasian' & is_recid == 0)
```

The process for sampling to get a non-discrimatory sample is as follows.

1. Compute the expected size for each group if the data were non-discriminatory
2. Under- and over-sample accordingly to eliminate descrimination
3. Train the model on the sampled data

In order to get an estimation of how biased our model is after making this adjustment to the data, we nest this process in cross-validation. Thus our overall process will be the following (using k-fold cross-validation).

1. Split the data into k folds
2. Hold out one fold as test data, use the remaining k-1 folds as training data
3. Perform sampling on the training data
    - Compute the expected size for each group if the data were non-discriminatory
    - Under- and over-sample accordingly to eliminate descrimination
4. Train our model on the training data
5. Predict recidivism scores on the test data and store predictions
6. Repeat (2) - (5) for each fold, getting one prediction for each data point
7. Compute relative risk with new predictions

First we walk through an example of the sampling process on the whole data set before embedding the enitre process in cross-validation.

### Demonstration of the sampling process

#### 1. Compute the expected size for each group if the data were non-discriminatory
    
Here we have the following counts for each group:

```{r}
recid_rates %>% filter(race %in% c('African-American', 'Caucasian'))
```

Thus we'll say the expected number of observations for each group is the mean of the four counts:

```{r}
(expected_num_observations <- mean(c(nrow(DP_data), nrow(DN_data), nrow(FP_data), nrow(FN_data))))
```

#### 2. Under- and over-sample to eliminate descrimination

We want equal representation for each group (DP, DN, FP, and FN). This means getting `r expected_num_observations` observations of each. We under- or over-sample accordingly. Kamiran and Calders describe two methods for performing this sampling: *Preferential Sampling*, which is more likely to sample boundary observations (with a high probability of being in either class); and *Uniform Sampling*, which samples all points with equal probability. Here we perform Uniform Sampling with replacement. 

```{r}
set.seed(123)
# sample indices
DP_sampled_indices <- sample(1:nrow(DP_data), size = expected_num_observations, replace = TRUE)
DN_sampled_indices <- sample(1:nrow(DN_data), size = expected_num_observations, replace = TRUE)
FP_sampled_indices <- sample(1:nrow(FP_data), size = expected_num_observations, replace = TRUE)
FN_sampled_indices <- sample(1:nrow(FN_data), size = expected_num_observations, replace = TRUE)
```

And we build a new data set from the sampled observations.

```{r}
# build a new data set
sampled_compas_data <- rbind(
  DP_data[DP_sampled_indices,],
  DN_data[DN_sampled_indices,],
  FP_data[FP_sampled_indices,],
  FN_data[FN_sampled_indices,]
)
```

We double check visually that our sampling successfully leveled the classes for each partition.

```{r}
sampled_compas_data %>%
  filter(race %in% c('African-American', 'Caucasian')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = is_recid, color = race)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 2) +
    facet_wrap(~ race)
```

With Uniform Sampling applied to our data for the *black/white* protected race attributes, we're ready to train our model again and see (1) if its level of bias has decreased and also see (2) how its predictive accuracy has changed. 

#### 3. Train the model on the sampled data

Here we'll train the model following the same process from above and see how our bias (measured by ProPublica's methodology) compares to the bias before sampling.

We train our logistic regression model.

```{r}
vars <- sampled_compas_data %>% 
  select(sex, age, ends_with('count'), c_charge_degree, is_recid)
post_sample_regmod <- glm(is_recid ~., family = binomial(link='logit'), data = vars)
```

Next we would predict scores **for observations we haven't seen**. Given that we didn't hold out a test set, we don't have any such observations. However, we have now seen how sampling works and are thus ready to do so within cross-validation. 

### Sampling with Cross-validation 

Given that we have seen most of the following process step by step in previous sections, we implement this section without explanation of those parts we have seen already.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
all_predictions <- data.frame(id = compas_data$id, predicted_score = NA)
  
#### 1. Split the data into 10 folds
all_indices <- 1:nrow(compas_data)
folds <- createFolds(all_indices, k = 10)

#### 2. Hold out one fold as test data, use the remaining k-1 folds as training data
for (i in 1:10) {
  test_indices <- folds[[i]]
  training_indices <- all_indices[-test_indices]
  test_data <- compas_data[test_indices,]
  training_data <- compas_data[training_indices,]
  
  #### 3. Perform sampling on the training data
  # create partitions
  DP_data <- training_data %>%
    filter(race == 'African-American' & is_recid == 1)
  DN_data <- training_data %>%
    filter(race == 'African-American' & is_recid == 0)
  FP_data <- training_data %>%
    filter(race == 'Caucasian' & is_recid == 1)
  FN_data <- training_data %>%
    filter(race == 'Caucasian' & is_recid == 0)
  # get expected number of observations
  expected_num_observations <- mean(c(nrow(DP_data), nrow(DN_data), nrow(FP_data), nrow(FN_data)))
  # under- and over-sample to eliminate descrimination
  DP_sampled_indices <- sample(1:nrow(DP_data), size = expected_num_observations, replace = TRUE)
  DN_sampled_indices <- sample(1:nrow(DN_data), size = expected_num_observations, replace = TRUE)
  FP_sampled_indices <- sample(1:nrow(FP_data), size = expected_num_observations, replace = TRUE)
  FN_sampled_indices <- sample(1:nrow(FN_data), size = expected_num_observations, replace = TRUE)
  # build new data set
  sampled_training_data <- rbind(
    DP_data[DP_sampled_indices,],
    DN_data[DN_sampled_indices,],
    FP_data[FP_sampled_indices,],
    FN_data[FN_sampled_indices,]
  )
  
  #### 4. Train our model on the training data
  vars <- sampled_training_data %>% 
    select(sex, age, ends_with('count'), c_charge_degree, is_recid)
  post_sample_regmod <- glm(is_recid ~., family = binomial(link='logit'), data = vars)
  
  #### 5. Predict recidivism scores on the test data and store predictions
  predicted_scores <- predict(post_sample_regmod, newdata = test_data, type = 'response')
  all_predictions[names(predicted_scores),]$predicted_score <- predicted_scores
}
#### 7. Compute relative risk with new predictions
# turn predictions from log odds ratios into probabilities of recidivating
recidivism_scores <- all_predictions$predicted_score
# create new scores and score categories
post_sample_scores <- compas_data %>%
  mutate(new_score = recidivism_scores) %>%
  mutate(
    new_score_text = as.factor(
      ifelse(new_score >= 0.75, 'High',
             ifelse(new_score >= 0.45, 'Medium', 'Low'))))
# build ProPublica's data frame with our scores
post_sample_df <- post_sample_scores %>%
  select(age, c_charge_degree, race, age_cat, new_score_text, sex, priors_count, days_b_screening_arrest, new_score, is_recid, two_year_recid, c_jail_in, c_jail_out) %>% 
  filter(days_b_screening_arrest <= 30) %>%
  filter(days_b_screening_arrest >= -30) %>%
  filter(is_recid != -1) %>%
  filter(c_charge_degree != "O") %>%
  filter(new_score_text != 'N/A') %>%
  mutate(crime_factor = factor(c_charge_degree)) %>%
  mutate(age_factor = as.factor(age_cat)) %>%
  within(age_factor <- relevel(age_factor, ref = "25 - 45")) %>%
  mutate(race_factor = factor(race)) %>%
  within(race_factor <- relevel(race_factor, ref = "Caucasian")) %>%
  mutate(gender_factor = factor(sex, labels= c("Female","Male"))) %>%
  within(gender_factor <- relevel(gender_factor, ref = "Male")) %>%
  mutate(score_factor = factor(new_score_text != "Low", labels = c("LowScore","HighScore")))
# train ProPublica's model
post_sample_pp_model <- glm(
  score_factor ~ gender_factor + age_factor + race_factor + priors_count + crime_factor + two_year_recid,
  family="binomial",
  data=post_sample_df
)
```

Now we can measure the amount of bias in our model after applying sampling and compare to the bias before.

### Bias Before and After Sampling

We can re-compute the relative risk for blacks vs. whites and compare it to the relative risk for our model before sampling to see if sampling improved the level of bias in our mode.

```{r}
model_intercept <- coef(post_sample_pp_model)['(Intercept)']
black_coef <- coef(post_sample_pp_model)['race_factorAfrican-American']
(post_sample_relative_risk_black_v_white <- sigmoid(model_intercept + black_coef) / sigmoid(model_intercept))
```

Taking the ratio and subtracting from 1, we were able to decrease the bias in relative risk by:

```{r}
pre_sample_relative_risk_black_v_white <- relative_risk_black_v_white
1 - post_sample_relative_risk_black_v_white / pre_sample_relative_risk_black_v_white
```
